NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BASIS OF PRESENTATION

In the opinion of management, the accompanying balance sheets and related
interim statements of income and cash flows include all adjustments (consisting
only of normal recurring items) necessary for their fair presentation.  The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and
expenses.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.  Interim results
are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year.  The information
included in this Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with Management's
Discussion and Analysis and financial statements and notes thereto included in
the Microsoft Corporation 1995 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

EARNINGS PER SHARE

Earnings per share is computed on the basis of the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding plus the effect of outstanding stock options, using
the treasury stock method.

MERGER

During January 1996, Microsoft merged with Vermeer Technologies, Inc., a
developer of Web authoring software.  The transaction will be accounted for as
a pooling of interests.  Management does not expect the transaction to have a
material financial effect on the Company's financial results.

CONTINGENCIES

The Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice has stated that it is
conducting an investigation concerning Microsoft's inclusion of client-access
software for The Microsoft Network in Microsoft Windows(R) 95.  Although there
is no assurance that this matter will be resolved favorably and that
Microsoft's future financial statements will not be adversely affected,
Microsoft currently believes that resolution of this matter will not have a
material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations.

ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Microsoft develops, manufactures, licenses, sells, and supports a wide range of
software products, including operating systems for personal computers (PCs),
workstations, and servers; business and consumer programs for productivity,
reference, education, and entertainment; and development tools.  Microsoft also
offers an online service, sells personal computer books and input devices, and
is engaged in the research and potential development of advanced technology
software products.

REVENUES

Revenues for the second quarter of fiscal 1996 increased 48% over revenues for
the second quarter of fiscal 1995.  For the first half of the year, revenues
increased 54% over the comparable period of the prior year.

Software license volume (as opposed to price) increases have been the principal
factor in Microsoft's revenue growth.  The average selling price per license
has decreased, primarily because of general shifts in the sales mix from retail
packaged products to licensing programs, from new products to product upgrades,
and from stand-alone desktop applications to integrated product suites.
Average revenue per license from original equipment manufacturer (OEM) licenses
and corporate license programs, such as Microsoft Select, is lower than average
revenue per license from retail versions.  Likewise, product upgrades have
lower prices than new products.  Also, prices of integrated suites, e.g.,
Microsoft Office, are less than the sum of the prices for the individual
programs included in these products when such programs are licensed separately.

PRODUCT GROUPS

Platforms product group revenues were $1.13 billion in the second quarter of
1996, compared to $592 million recorded in the same period of 1995, an increase
of 90%.  On a year-to-date basis, platforms product group revenues increased to
$2.17 billion from $1.10 billion.  Platforms product group revenues are 
primarily from licenses of personal computer operating systems and business     
systems with client-server architectures.

During the first quarter of fiscal 1996, the Company released Microsoft Windows
95, its new personal computer operating system, which experienced strong demand
by users of existing PCs.  To prevent stock outs in the retail channel, certain
distributors and resellers over-ordered Windows 95 product prior to its formal
launch on August 24, 1995 and began returning excess inventory in the first two
quarters of 1996.  The Company provided for management's estimate of additional
product that will be returned to Microsoft.  The Company's earned retail
revenues of Windows 95 were $260 million in the first quarter and $180 million
in the second quarter.  Additionally, unearned revenues as of December 31, 1995
on the accompanying balance sheet include $200 million attributable to future
telephone support and unspecified enhancements to Windows 95 which will be
recognized ratably over the product's life cycle as it is earned.  The Company
also experienced continued revenue growth in Microsoft MS-DOS(R), Microsoft
Windows 3.1, Microsoft Windows for Workgroups 3.11, and Windows 95 operating
systems licensed through the OEM channel.  (Windows 3.1 and Windows for
Workgroups 3.11 are hereafter referred to collectively as "Windows 3.x.").
Revenues from business systems products (principally the Windows NT(TM)
operating system and server applications in the Microsoft's BackOffice(TM)
family of products) increased strongly, due to greater corporate demand for
Windows NT Workstation and Windows NT Server.

Applications and content product group revenues were $1.07 billion in the
second quarter of 1996, increasing 20% from $890 million in the second quarter
of 1995.  For the first two quarters of 1996, applications and content product
revenues were $2.05 billion, compared to $1.63 billion in the corresponding
period of 1995.  Applications product group revenues include primarily licenses
of desktop productivity, consumer, and developer programs.

Increases in applications and content revenues were led by strong sales of
16-bit and 32-bit versions of Microsoft Office.  Microsoft Office Standard
includes the Microsoft Word word processor, the Microsoft Excel spreadsheet,
and the Microsoft PowerPoint(R) presentation graphics program.  The Microsoft
Office for Windows 95 (32-bit) version also includes the Microsoft Schedule+
calendar and scheduling program.  Microsoft Office Professional includes all of
the above plus the Microsoft Access(R) database management program.  The
accompanying balance sheet also includes $230 million of unearned revenues as
of December 31, 1995 in connection with the sale of 16-bit versions of desktop
productivity programs that will not be earned and recognized as revenues until
related coupons for Windows 95 version upgrades have been fulfilled.

<PAGE>   8
Revenues from consumer products grew 23% in the second quarter of 1996.  New
titles and new versions of existing titles both contributed to the growth, in
spite of across-the-board price decreases.  Developer product revenues also
grew, reflecting the introduction of Microsoft Visual Basic version 4.0.

SALES CHANNELS

Microsoft distributes its products primarily through OEM licenses, corporate
licenses, and retail packaged products.  OEM channel revenues are license fees
from original equipment manufacturers.  Microsoft has three major geographic
sales and marketing organizations: U.S. and Canada, Europe, and elsewhere in
the world (Other International).  Sales of corporate licenses and packaged
products in these channels are primarily to distributors and resellers.

OEM revenues (primarily personal computer operating systems) grew 75% to $672
million in the second quarter from the $385 million recorded in the comparable
quarter of the prior year.  On a year-to-date basis, OEM revenues were $1.22
billion, compared to $733 million in 1995.  The percentage of OEMs
preinstalling Windows 95 on new PCs increased during the second quarter of
1996.  Also, MS-DOS and Microsoft Windows 3.x continued to be preinstalled on
many PCs sold by OEMs.  Higher levels of PC shipments was the principal driver
of increased revenues through the OEM channel.

Revenues in the U.S. and Canada were $632 million in the second quarter of 1996
compared to $491 million in 1995.  Revenues in the first half of 1996 were
$1.38 billion, compared to $914 million recorded last year.  The increase in
revenues of 51% for the first two quarters primarily reflects the release of
new versions of Windows 95 and 32-bit versions of desktop applications,
particularly Microsoft Office for Windows 95.

Revenues in Europe were $569 million in the second quarter of 1996 compared to
$399 million the prior year.  European revenues were $995 million in the first
half of 1996 compared to $688 million the prior year, an increase of 45%.
Revenues in Europe benefited greatly by the release of localized versions of
Windows 95 and 32-bit desktop applications.

Other International channel revenues increased 56% to $322 million in the
second quarter of 1996 from $207 million in the second quarter of 1995,
reflecting the release of Kanji versions of Windows 95 and Microsoft Office in
Japan.  Year-to-date revenues were $619 million in 1996 compared to $394
million in 1995.  As in Europe, many localized versions of Windows 95 and
32-bit desktop applications were released through the Other International
channel in the first half of 1996.

Microsoft's operating results are affected by foreign exchange rates.  Had the
exchange rates in effect during the second quarter of the prior year been in
effect during the second quarter of 1996, translated revenues in Europe would
have been $21 million lower and translated Other International revenues would
have been $4 million higher.  Since much of Microsoft's international
manufacturing costs and operating expenses are also incurred in local
currencies, the relative translation impact of exchange rates on net income is
less than on revenues.

COSTS AND EXPENSES, NONOPERATING ITEMS, AND INCOME TAXES

Cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues was 15.0% in the second quarters
of both 1996 and 1995.  For the first two quarters of 1996, cost of revenues
was 15.5% of revenues, compared to 15.0% the prior year.  The slight increase
is principally attributable to a shift in sales mix due to high shipments of
retail upgrade versions of Windows 95 and Microsoft Office for Windows 95.  The
increase in the cost of revenues percentage was somewhat offset by the
increased mix of CD-ROM media, which carry lower costs of goods sold than
floppy disks.

Research and development expenses increased 57% to $313 million, or 14.3% of
revenues in the second quarter of 1996 from $199 million, or 13.4% of revenues
in the corresponding quarter of 1995. The increase in research and development
expenses in both the second quarter and first half of 1996 resulted primarily
from planned hiring of software developers and higher levels of third-party
development costs.

Sales and marketing expenses increased 44% to $690 million from $479 million in
the comparable quarter.  As a percentage of revenues, sales and marketing
expenses were 31.4% and 32.3% in the respective second quarters of 1996 and
1995.  The increase in sales and marketing expenses in both the second quarter
and first half of 1996 was impacted by marketing costs of Windows 95 and
Microsoft Office for Windows 95 and increased product support costs.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                       6
<PAGE>   9
General and administrative expenses were $76 million (3.5% of revenues) in the
second quarter of 1996 and $62 million (4.2% of revenues) in the second quarter
of 1995.  The increases in absolute dollars incurred in both the second quarter
and first half of 1996 were due to growth in the systems and number of people
necessary to support overall increases in the scope of the Company's
operations.

Net interest income increased as a result of a larger investment portfolio
generated by cash from operations combined with higher interest rates.  Other
income in the second quarter of 1996 included a net gain of $30 million from
the disposal of long-term assets.

The effective income tax rate was 35% and 33% in the first halves of 1996 and
1995 with the increase due primarily to changes in the U.S. tax law.

NET INCOME

Net income for the second quarter of 1996 was $575 million.  Net income as a
percentage of revenues was 26.2% in the second quarter of 1996, compared with
25.2% in the second quarter of 1995.  On a year-to-date basis, net income as a
percent of revenues was 25.5% compared to 25.2% the prior year.  The increase
in net income as a percentage of revenues was primarily the result of revenues
growing faster than operating expenses other than those for research and
development and higher nonoperating income such as interest income and the
disposal gain.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

Microsoft's cash and short-term investment portfolio totaled $6 billion at
December 31, 1995.  The portfolio is diversified among security types,
industries, and individual issuers.  Microsoft's investments are liquid and
investment grade.  The portfolio is invested predominantly in U.S. dollar
denominated securities, but also includes foreign currency positions in
anticipation of continued international expansion.  The portfolio is invested
in short-term securities to minimize interest rate risk and facilitate rapid
deployment in the event of immediate cash needs.

Microsoft has no material long-term debt and has $70 million of standby
multicurrency lines of credit that support foreign currency hedging and
international cash management.  Stockholders' equity at December 31, 1995
exceeded $6 billion.

Cash generated from operations has been sufficient historically to fund
Microsoft's investment in research and development activities and facilities
expansion.  As Microsoft grows, investments will continue in research and
development in existing and advanced areas of technology.  Microsoft's cash
will be used to acquire technology and to fund ventures and other strategic
opportunities.  Additions to property, plant, and equipment are expected to
continue, including new facilities and computer systems for research and
development, sales and marketing, product support, and administrative staff.

The exercise of stock options by employees provides additional cash.  These
proceeds have funded Microsoft's open market stock repurchase program through
which Microsoft provides shares for stock option and stock purchase plans.
This practice is continuing in 1996.

To enhance its stock repurchase program, Microsoft sold equity put warrants to
independent third parties during 1995 and 1996.  These put warrants entitle the
holders to sell shares of Microsoft common stock to the Company on certain
dates at specified prices.  On December 31, 1995, 10 million warrants were
outstanding with strike prices ranging between $82 and $91 per share.  The
warrants expire at various dates between the fourth quarter of 1996 and the
fourth quarter of 1997, are exercisable only at maturity, and are settleable in
cash at Microsoft's option.  The maximum potential repurchase obligation as of
December 31, 1995, $560 million, has been reclassified from stockholders'
equity to put warrants.

A subsidiary of Tele-Communications, Inc. (TCI) owns a 20% minority interest in
The Microsoft Network, LLC.  TCI contributed $125 million of TCI common stock,
and Microsoft contributed the business assets of its online service, The
Microsoft Network, which began operation in August 1995.

During December 1995, Microsoft and NBC announced the creation of two
joint ventures: a 24-hour cable news and information channel and an interactive
online news service distributed on The Microsoft Network.  Both of these
services will be offered worldwide and integrated with the NBC Television
Network.  Microsoft has agreed to pay $220 million over five years for its
interest in the cable venture.

Management believes existing cash and short-term investments together with
funds generated from operations will be sufficient to meet operating
requirements for the next twelve months.  Microsoft's cash and short-term
investments are also managed to be available for strategic investment
opportunities or other potential large-scale cash needs that may arise in
pursuit of Microsoft's long-term strategies.  Additionally, Microsoft
shareholders have authorized the issuance of up to 100 million shares of
preferred stock, which may be used by Microsoft for any proper corporate
purpose.

Microsoft has not paid cash dividends on its common stock.
