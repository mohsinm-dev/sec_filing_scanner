Notes to Financial Statements
(Unaudited)


Basis Of Presentation

In the opinion of management, the accompanying balance sheets and related
interim statements of income and cash flows include all adjustments (consisting
only of normal recurring items) necessary for their fair presentation.  Interim
results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year.  The
information included in this Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the
Management's Discussion and Analysis and financial statements and notes thereto
included in the Microsoft Corporation 1993 Annual Report.

Earnings Per Share

Earnings per share is computed on the basis of the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding plus the effect of outstanding stock options, computed
using the treasury stock method.

Contingencies

On March 17, 1988, Apple Computer, Inc. brought suit against Microsoft and
Hewlett-Packard Company for alleged copyright infringement in the U.S. District
Court, Northern District of California.  The complaint included allegations that
the visual displays of Microsoft(R) Windows/TM/ version 2.03 infringed Apple's
copyrights and exceeded the scope of a 1985 Settlement Agreement between
Microsoft and Apple.  The complaint sought to enjoin Microsoft from marketing
Microsoft Windows version 2.03 or any derivative work based on Windows 2.03 and
from otherwise infringing Apple's copyrights and sought damages resulting from
the alleged infringement.  The complaint also alleged that Microsoft was a
contributory infringer as to a Hewlett-Packard(R) product called NewWave/TM/.
 
The Company answered the complaint, denying Apple's allegations that the visual
displays in Microsoft Windows version 2.03 infringe any protectible right of
Apple, raising affirmative defenses, asserting counterclaims, and seeking
damages in an unspecified amount resulting from Apple's actions.
 
In a June 14, 1991 order, the Court permitted Apple to supplement its complaint
to include Windows version 3.0 as an allegedly infringing work.  Later in 1991,
the Court dismissed Microsoft's counterclaim in which it alleged that Apple had
breached an implied covenant not to sue for infringement as to any visual
displays covered by the 1985 Agreement.
 
On February 11, 1992, Microsoft disclosed Apple's written claim for $4.4 billion
as damages from Microsoft's alleged infringement of Apple's copyrights.  Apple
later amended this claim to $5.5 billion and more recently to $4.9 billion. 
Microsoft considers Apple's damages claim to be insupportable under the
copyright law and speculative.
 
On August 24, 1993, the Court entered final judgment dismissing all of Apple's
claims.  Apple has appealed a number of the Court's decisions in the case to the
Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.  Microsoft has cross-appealed the dismissal of
its counterclaim and related issues.
 
In June 1990, Microsoft was notified that it was the subject of a nonpublic
investigation being conducted by the staff of the Federal Trade Commission
("Commission").  During further communications, the Company learned that the
staff wished to determine if Microsoft and the IBM Corporation had entered into
an alleged anticompetitive horizontal agreement that was purportedly reflected
in a joint press release issued at the COMDEX computer trade show in November
1989.  In April 1991, Microsoft learned that, apparently due to complaints from
third parties, the staff had decided to broaden the investigation to examine
allegations that the Company has monopolized or has attempted to monopolize the
market for operating systems, operating environments, computer software, and
peripherals for personal computers.  The Company produced documents, witnesses,
and other information to the FTC staff in connection with the investigation.

In a letter dated August 20, 1993, the Commission notified Microsoft that its
investigation had been closed.

                                       4
<PAGE>
 
The Company was also notified on August 20, 1993 that the U.S. Department of
Justice had been granted clearance by the Commission to investigate Microsoft. 
That investigation is underway, and the Company is cooperating.
 
On July 20, 1993, Microsoft was notified by the Commission of the European
Communities that the Directorate-General for Competition had received a
complaint from Novell, Inc. against Microsoft.  The complaint claims that
certain allegedly anti-competitive practices of Microsoft violated Articles 85
and 86 of the EEC Treaty of Rome, and includes a request for interim measures. 
Microsoft is cooperating with the investigation of Novell's claims being
conducted by the Directorate-General for Competition.
 
On January 25, 1993, Stac Electronics ("Stac") of Carlsbad, California, filed
suit against Microsoft in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, alleging that
Microsoft's MS-DOS(R) version 6 operating system infringes two patents owned
by Stac relating to data compression techniques. Stac seeks monetary relief
and an injunction prohibiting the sale of products that include Microsoft's
DoubleSpace(TM) technology. Microsoft has denied that its DoubleSpace
technology infringes the Stac patents, and has asked the Court to declare
those patents invalid and unenforceable for failing to meet the patent law
requirements. Microsoft has also filed counterclaims alleging that Stac's
Stacker(R) compression products infringe a patent owned by Microsoft; that Stac
has engaged in unfair competition; and that Stac misappropriated Microsoft trade
secrets relating to Microsoft's proprietary technology for integrating data
compression into the MS-DOS operating system.

On November 15, 1993, Judge Edward Rafeedie denied Microsoft's motion for 
summary adjudication that MS-DOS 6 does not infringe Stac's patents. The trial
of the matter commenced on January 18, 1994, and the case was submitted to the
jury on February 11, 1994. Stac is seeking damages in the amount of $113 
million. Should Stac's patents be found to be valid and Microsoft's 
DoubleSpace technology be determined to infringe them, monetary damages, which
could be trebled if the jury finds willful infringement, could be awarded to 
Stac, and an injunction could be entered prohibiting the manufacture, use and 
sale of products containing the infringing technology. Such an injunction
could cause a temporary disruption in Microsoft's licensing and shipping of the
affected products while they are being made non-infringing.

Management currently believes that the resolution of these matters will not 
have a material adverse financial effect on the Company.

ITEM 2.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
         of Operations

Results of Operations

Overview

Microsoft's business strategy emphasizes the development and sale of a broad
line of software products, including operating systems for personal computers,
office machines, and personal information devices; application programs;
languages; and other hardware, book, and multimedia products.

Net revenues for the second quarter of fiscal 1994 increased 20% over net
revenues for the second quarter of fiscal 1993.  Revenues were $2.11 billion for
the first six months of fiscal 1994, an increase of 20% over the comparable
period of the prior year.

Product Groups

Operating systems sales were $369 million in the second quarter of 1994, growing
30% from the $283 million recorded in the same period of 1993.  Systems revenues
were $724 million in the first half of 1994 compared to $541 million in the
first half of 1993.  Revenues generated by the Microsoft MS-DOS operating
system increased from the prior year.  During the second quarter of fiscal 1994,
the Company released MS-DOS version 6.2, which led to increased sales through
the retail channels.  Sales of the Microsoft Windows operating system also
increased, particularly through the original equipment manufacturer channel. 
During the second quarter of 1994, more than 80% of Windows units were sold
through the OEM channel.

Applications revenues were $707 million in the second quarter of 1994, compared
to $590 million in the second quarter of 1993.  For the first two quarters of
1994, applications revenues were $1.28 billion, compared to $1.08 billion in
1993.  Increases in applications revenues were led by sales of Windows-based
products, particularly Microsoft Office. Microsoft Office Standard includes
Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Word, a Microsoft Mail license, and the Microsoft
PowerPoint(R) presentation graphics program.  Microsoft Office Professional for
Windows includes all of the above plus the Microsoft Access(R) database
management program.

During the second quarter of 1994, the Company released new versions of
Microsoft Office Standard and Microsoft Office Professional for Windows.  These
products contained vouchers for free upgrades to the next versions of Microsoft
Excel and Microsoft PowerPoint.  Revenues of approximately $70 million were
deferred and will be recognized when upgrades for Microsoft Excel version 5.0
and Microsoft PowerPoint version 4.0 are shipped to users who licensed Microsoft
Office and return the vouchers.

The Company introduced several new consumer software products in the second
quarter of 1994, which also impacted the increase in applications revenue
growth.

Hardware revenues were $53 million and $65 million in the second quarters of
1994 and 1993.  On a year to date basis, hardware revenues were $104 million in
1994 and $131 million in 1993.  The hardware product group's principal products
are the Microsoft Mouse and BallPoint(R) mouse pointing devices.  Mouse revenues
per unit are lower in the OEM channel than in the Company's retail channels, and
the percentage of mouse sales through the OEM channel increased from the
comparable quarter of the prior year.

Sales Channels

The Company has three major channels of distribution: U.S. and Canada,
International, and OEM. Sales in the U.S. and Canada and International channels
are primarily to distributors and resellers.  OEM channel revenues are license
fees from original equipment manufacturers.

Revenues in the U.S. and Canada grew to $423 million in the second quarter of
1994 from $344 million in 1993, an increase of 23%.  For the first half of 1994,
revenues were $751 million, compared to $653 million in the first half of 1993.

Revenues in Europe were $324 million in the second quarter of 1994 compared to
$345 million the prior year.  For the first two quarters, European revenues were
$598 million in 1994 and $628 million in 1993.  Other international revenues
showed strong growth, increasing to $114 million in the second quarter of 1994
from $88 million in the second quarter of 1993.  On a year to date basis, other
international revenues were $240 million in 1994 and $164 million in 1993,
representing growth of 46%.

                                       6
<PAGE>
 
The Company's operating results are affected by foreign exchange rates.  Had the
exchange rates in effect during the second quarter of the prior year been in
effect during the second quarter of 1994, translated revenues would have been 3%
higher in the second quarter of 1994.  Since much of the Company's international
manufacturing costs and operating expenses are incurred in local currencies, the
total impact of exchange rates on net income is less than on revenues.

OEM revenues (primarily operating systems) grew 66% to $268 million from the
$161 million recorded in the comparable quarter of the prior year.  For the
first half of 1994, OEM revenues were $523 million, compared to $311 million in
the first half of 1993.  MS-DOS continues to be pre-installed on many personal
computers sold by original equipment manufacturers. In addition, many major OEMs
are also preinstalling the Microsoft Windows operating system on personal
computers, leading to increased revenues through the OEM channel.

Cost of revenues as a percentage of net revenues decreased slightly to 16.4% in
the second quarter of 1994 from 16.7% in the second quarter of 1993.  On a year
to date basis, cost of revenues was 16.3% in 1994 and 16.6% in 1993.  Cost of
revenues varies with the channel mix and product mix within channels.

Research and development expenses increased 35% to $150 million, or 13.3% of net
revenues in the second quarter of 1994 from $111 million, or 11.8% of net
revenues in the corresponding quarter of 1993.  For the first half of 1994,
research and development expenses represented 13.4% of net revenues, compared to
12.3% in 1993.  The increase in research and development expenses followed the
trend established over the last several years, and resulted primarily from
planned hiring of software development staff and higher levels of third-party
development costs.

Sales and marketing expenses increased 7% to $337 million from $315 million in
the comparable quarter.  As a percentage of net revenues, sales and marketing
expenses were 29.9% and 33.6% in the respective second quarters of 1994 and 1993
and 30.8% and 32.9% in the respective first halves of 1994 and 1993.  The
increase in absolute amounts of sales and marketing expenses was primarily due
to increased marketing costs associated with the promotion of new products and
the new editions of Microsoft Office.

General and administrative expenses were 3.7% of net revenues in the second
quarter of 1994 and 3.1% of net revenues in the second quarter of 1993.

Net interest income increased as a result of a larger investment portfolio
generated by cash from operations, offset by declining interest rates.  Other
expense did not fluctuate significantly.

The effective income tax rate was 34% in the second quarter of 1994, compared to
32% in 1993, reflecting newly-enacted U.S. income tax laws.

Net income for the second quarter of 1994 was $289 million, a 22% increase over
the $236 million in the corresponding quarter of 1993.  Net income as a
percentage of net revenues was 25.6% in the second quarter of 1994, compared
with 25.2% in the second quarter of 1993.  On a year to date basis, net income
as a percent of net revenues was 25.0% in 1994 and 25.3% in 1993.

Financial Condition

The Company's cash and short-term investment portfolio totaled $2.80 billion at
December 31, 1993 and represented 62% of total assets.  The portfolio is
diversified among security types, industry groups, and individual issuers.  The
Company's investments are investment grade and liquid.  The portfolio, while
invested predominantly in U.S. dollar denominated securities, also includes
foreign currency positions in anticipation of continued international expansion.

Microsoft has no material long-term debt.  Stockholders' equity at December 31,
1993 was $3.75 billion.

Cash generated from operations has been sufficient to fund the Company's
investment in research and development activities and facilities expansion.  As
the Company grows, investments will continue in research and development in
existing and advanced areas of technology. Cash may also be used to acquire
technology or to fund strategic ventures.  Additions to property, plant, and
equipment are expected to continue, including new facilities and computer
systems for research and development; sales and marketing; product support; and
administrative staff.

                                       7
<PAGE>
 
The exercise of stock options by employees provides additional cash.  Funds
received have been used to repurchase the Company's common stock on the open
market, to provide shares for stock option and stock purchase plans.  This
practice is continuing in 1994.

The Company has available $70 million of standby multicurrency lines of credit. 
These lines support foreign currency hedging and international cash management.

Management believes existing cash and short-term investments together with funds
generated from operations should be sufficient to meet the Company's operating
requirements.
